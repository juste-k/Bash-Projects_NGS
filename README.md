# Bash-Projects_NGS
- The purpose of these projects is to demonstrate my ability to work with Unix environment (Bash) and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data manipulation tools:
  * Project 1 - Basic Unix commands
  * Project 2 - SAMtools and BEDtools
  * Project 3 - Bowtie2 and BCFtools

- Also, these projects show my knowledge of a variety of genomic data file formats (FASTA, FASTQ, BED, GFF/GTF, SAM/BAM, Pileup, VCF/BCF).

- The goal of every project is written inside the `Bash_NGS.Rmd` / `Bash_NGS.md` file.
